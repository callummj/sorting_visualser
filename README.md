# A graphical app to compare sorting algoritms

A graphical app using React.js which aims to compare sorting algorithms for an educational use setting. An array of randomly generated numbers is created which can be then visualised and compared visually.

To run the program in a developer environment: use *npm start* to compile the code and run it on a localhost address; navigate to the localhost in the web browser, by default this is port 3000.

To use the program: first, generate some data using the **generate data** button in the Toolbar at the top. Select the algorithms available you would like to compare using the buttons provided labelled "<*algorithm* \> Sort". Click *Sort* in the toolbar to begin the animation.  You can control the speed in which the animation playes using the slider labelled speed in the bottom toolbar.
